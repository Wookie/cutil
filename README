This library of miscelaneous data structures depends only on the CUnit unit
test library.  It is not necessary to install CUnit to build the static
library.  But if you wish to run the unit tests, you must install it first.

If you are compiling with gcc and you have gcov and lcov installed, you can 
generate the unit test coverage by running "make coverage".  To view the
coverage report, open coverage/index.html in your browser.

The Makefile is sensitive to the PREFIX environment variable.  If you set it
and then run "make install" it will build the static library and copy it to
$(PREFIX)/lib.  If you do not specify a value for PREFIX, then it defaults to
/usr/local.
