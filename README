This library of miscelaneous data structures depends only on the CUnit unit
test library.  It is not necessary to install CUnit to build the static
library.  But if you wish to run the unit tests, you must install it first.

The Makefile is sensitive to the PREFIX environment variable.  If you set it
and then run "make install" it will build the static library and copy it to
$(PREFIX)/lib.  If you do not specify a value for PREFIX, then it defaults to
/usr/local.
